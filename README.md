# Cifar10ObjectRecognition
Object Recognition on CIFAR10 dataset using a simple deep learning architecture<br>
This work has been implemented using Tensorflow and Keras.<br>
We used pre-trained ResNet50 weights as transfer learning for the backbone of our architecture.<br>
Here is a link to the weights : https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/releases/download/v0.2/resnet50_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop.h5 <br>
